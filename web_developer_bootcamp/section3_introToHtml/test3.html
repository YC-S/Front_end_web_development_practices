        The Welsh Corgi, sometimes known as just a Corgi (/ˈkɔːrɡi/, Welsh for
        "dwarf dog";[5] plural "Corgis" or occasionally the etymologically
        consistent "Corgwn"; /ˈkɔːrɡuːn/), is a small type of herding dog that
        originated in Wales, United Kingdom.[6] Two separate breeds are
        recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi.
        Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs
        alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century, while the
        Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in
        particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund. A certain degree
        of interbreeding between the two types has been suggested to explain the
        similarities between the two.
